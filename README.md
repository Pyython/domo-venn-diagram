Venn Diagram for Domo BI tool.

## Getting Started

Inside a terminal -
Install CLI:
```
npm install -g ryuu
```
If this command fails, then make sure you have satisfied all the requirements for Git and Node installation, and that you have access to npm. If you're getting permission issues you can either use sudo when installing the CLI, or follow one of the these tutorials for fixing Node permissions:

* https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/fixing-npm-permissions
* http://www.johnpapa.net/how-to-use-npm-global-without-sudo-on-osx/


Clone Repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/Pyython/domo-sunburst.git
```

In manifest.json, change dataSetId to the ID of a data set within your Domo instance.  To do this, go to Data Center and click on the target data set.  The ID will be in the URL immediately following the /datasources/ part of the path.


Sign into Domo:
```
domo login
```

To preview in a local environment, run:
```
domo dev
```

To publish the visualization to your Domo instance, run:
```
domo publish
```

You can then find the app in the 'Asset Library' and begin to build cards to analyze overlaps between sets.
